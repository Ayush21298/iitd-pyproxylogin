Does what it says on the tin. \r\n\r\n###What?\r\n_what, of all the infinite possible actions, does this do?_  \r\n\r\nThis is a simple python script, that asks for your proxy category, userid, and password, and logs you in to the proxy servers.\r\n\r\n###How?\r\n_how, of all the infinite possible ways, should I use it?_  \r\n\r\nRun it. Or eat it for dinner.\r\n\r\n###Trust?\r\n_can you be trusted? What if you are stealing my passwords?_  \r\n\r\nGood Lord!! Read the source. If you are lazy enough not to read the source, and skeptic enough not to trust, maintain a distance of 2.45 meters from my code.\r\n\r\n###Legal?\r\n_can I copy this?_  \r\n\r\nThis is my intellectual property, original creation, and is copylefted. Use it for anything, but be warned that I am not liable, in any way, for any misuse, real or perceived, of this code.\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
